###Final Concept 

For my final I am thinking about the microbiome of New York City - the invisible, microbial world that surrounds us. Using the Tangram library, I wish to visualize the city as a shadow world and show the city through the eyes of microbes. If we could see the city as a microbe does, what would that look like? Are the buildings  clouds? Shadows? How does perception change?

### Protoype 2

Here I am attempting to make each microbe have a character and I am wanting to make a series of shaders that "personify" these microbes. How will the movement of the microbe change based on its function? How can we visualize this microbes?
